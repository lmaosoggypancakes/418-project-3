/** README(student):
 We provide a way to validate consistency between wire layout
 and occupancy. Within the program, a wire checker is provided 
 by:
 wr_checker Checker(wires, occupancy);
 and its validate() method can be called to validate the consistency.
 
 The struct below is the standard format for wires used by the wire checker.
 It contains a buffer that holds up to MAX_PTS_PER_WIRE points, and a num_pts
 field that specifies the number of points. Regardless of what representation you use for your wires, you should
 implement the Wire::to_validate_format method to convert your Wire
 to a validate_wire_t if you wish to use the checker.
*/

/* validate_wire_t is a format to represent wires by key points

For example a wire with 3 bend has 5 key poinst:
start, bend1, bend2, bend3, end.
Notice this implies two consecutive keypoints share at least same x or same y

num_pts is number of keypoints
p is an array store the xy coordinates of each keypoints

Requires (see validate.cpp validate_wire_t::cleanup() for how is this
checked）： (1) two consecutive keypoints share at least same x or same y, (2) 2
<= num_pts <= MAX_PTS_PER_WIRE.

/* TODO (student): Define the data structure for wire here.
Feel free to redefine this, notice you also need to change how bend is read in
inside main of wireroute.cpp.

A better readable way of define this is:
int start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, bend1_x, bend1_y, bend2_x, bend2_y, bend3_x,
bend3_y; but this might not be the most efficient way to define the solution
space for a wire with <= 3 bends.
