## Debug Boards (Small)

The `debug/` directory contains small sample boards intended for debugging your prototype.

A correct implementation should produce the **optimal** solution for each of the following test cases:

- `debug/debug_8_4.txt`
- `debug/debug_8_3bend.txt`
- `debug/debug_8_3bend_2bend.txt`

The remaining files in `debug/` are provided for additional (optional) testing focused on **correctness** and **efficiency**.

---

## Problem Size Boards

The `problemsize/` directory contains sample boards for evaluating how your solution performs as the **problem size varies**.

---

## Benchmark Boards

The `timeinput/` directory contains boards used to **benchmark** your solution’s runtime performance.
